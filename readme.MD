## üî¨ Calibration

Before using the honey quality tester, calibration of sensors is necessary:

1. **pH Sensor Calibration**:
   - Use the "Calibrate pH Sensor (4.01)" button with a 4.01 pH buffer solution
   - Use the "Calibrate pH Sensor (9.18)" button with a 9.18 pH buffer solution

2. **EC Sensor Calibration**:
   - Use the "Calibrate EC Sensor (1413)" button with 1413 ŒºS/cm solution
   - Use the "Calibrate EC Sensor (1288)" button with 1288 ŒºS/cm solution

3. **AS7341 Spectral Sensor Calibration**:
   - Use the "Calibrate AS7341" button with air/no sample

## üß™ Using the Tester

1. **Setup**:
   - Power on the device
   - Connect to the "ESP32-Honey Quality" WiFi network (password: 12345678)
   - Navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` in a web browser

2. **Analysis**:
   - Place honey sample in the testing chamber
   - Click "Start Analysis" button
   - Wait for approximately 10 seconds while measurements are collected
   - View results on the web interface or OLED display

3. **Interpreting Results**:
   - Results will show measured values for all parameters
   - The system will assess if the honey is likely authentic or adulterated
   - Results are automatically saved to the SD card

## üíæ Data Storage

Measurement results are stored on the SD card in JSON format including:
- Timestamp
- pH value
- EC value
- Moisture percentage
- Temperature & humidity
- Spectral absorbance readings (10 channels)
- Assessment result

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **No SD Card detected**: Check SD card is properly inserted and formatted
- **Sensor errors**: Ensure proper calibration before testing
- **Connection issues**: Verify power supply and wiring connections

## üìö Technical Details

This system uses multiple sensor data points to assess honey quality:

- **pH Analysis**: Pure honey typically has pH 3.4-6.1
- **Electrical Conductivity**: Measures ionic content, correlates with mineral content
- **Spectral Analysis**: AS7341 provides 10-channel spectral data to detect adulteration
- **Moisture Content**: Derived from EC measurements
- **Environmental Factors**: Temperature and humidity are monitored as control variables
